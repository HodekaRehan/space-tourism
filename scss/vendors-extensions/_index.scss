/*  
   If you have to override a section of any vendor,  use this 'vendors-extensions' folder in which you can have files named exactly after the vendors they overwrite.

   For instance, vendors-extensions/_bootstrap.scss is a file containing all CSS rules intended to re-declare some of Bootstrapâ€™s default CSS. This is to avoid editing the vendor files themselves, which is generally not a good idea.
